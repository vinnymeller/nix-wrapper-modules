# Adding modules!

There are 2 kinds of modules in this repository. One kind which defines the `package` option, and one kind which does not.

### Wrapper Modules

If you are making a wrapper module, i.e. one which **does** define the `config.package` option, and thus wraps a package:

You must define a `wrapperModules/<first_letter>/<your_package_name>/wrapper.nix` file.

The file must contain a single, unevaluated module. In other words, it must be importable without calling it like a function first.

All wrapper modules must have a `config.meta.maintainers = [ <your wlib.maintainers listing> ];` entry.

Wrapper modules set `config.package`. They are "for" a program. They import helper module(s) (usually `wlib.modules.default`), and then use those options to provide a module customized for that program.

### Helper Modules

If you are making a helper module, i.e. one which does **not** define the `config.package` option:

You must define a `modules/<your_module_name>/module.nix` file instead.

Just like for wrapper modules, the file must contain a single, unevaluated module. In other words, it must be importable without calling it like a function first.

All helper modules must have a `config.meta.maintainers = lib.mkDefault [ <your wlib.maintainers listing> ];` entry.

Helper modules are meant to either remove boilerplate and improve consistency for common actions, or be a base for making particular kinds of wrapper modules.

For example:

- If someone wanted to provide a common set of options people should implement for themes, they could provide a `wlib.modules.themes` module.
That module could take care of the boilerplate for defining theme options for the module writer, leaving importers of the `wlib.modules.themes` module free to just handle the values in `config`, while also giving people a generally consistent interface.
(If someone were to do that, adding a `wlib.types.palette` type would also be a great first step)

- If someone wanted to provide a `wlib.wrapperModules.nginx-docker`, to make a wrapper module for running `nginx` in a `docker` container.
They might first add a `wlib.modules.docker` that other people could use too, to give the same sort of support we currently offer for `makeWrapper`.
Then they could import the module and implement `nginx-docker` using their new helper module.

### For Both:

All options must have description fields, so that documentation can be generated and people can know how to use it!

You may optionally set the `meta.description` option to provide a short description to include alongside your generated option documentation.

`meta.description` accepts either a set of `{ pre ? "", post ? "" }`, or just a plain string, which will end up as `{ pre = "the string"; post = ""; }`.

`pre` will be added after the title and before the content. `post` will be added after the content.

## Guidelines and Examples:

When you provide an option to `enable` or `disable` something, you should call it `enable` regardless of its default value.
This prevents people from needing to look it up to use it, and prevents contributors from having to think too hard about which to call it.

When you provide a `wlib.types.file` option, you should name it the actual filename, especially if there are multiple, but `configFile` is also OK, especially if it is unambiguous.

If you do name it `configFile` instead, you can fix the filename if necessary/desired by setting `default.path` explicitly, as shown in the example below.

Keep in mind that even if you do not choose to use `wlib.types.file`, the user can usually still override the option that you set to provide the generated path if needed.

However, this makes the user of your module search for it, and in some situations, such as when your module is adding stuff to `list` or `DAL` type options, this can be slightly harder to override later.

So making use of the `wlib.types.file` type or giving some other method of overriding the filepath when providing a file is generally recommended for this reason.

Example:

```nix
{
  config,
  lib,
  wlib,
  pkgs,
  ...
}:
let
  gitIniFmt = pkgs.formats.gitIni { };
in
{
  imports = [ wlib.modules.default ];
  options = {
    settings = lib.mkOption {
      inherit (gitIniFmt) type;
      default = { };
      description = ''
        Git configuration settings.
        See {manpage}`git-config(1)` for available options.
      '';
    };

    configFile = lib.mkOption {
      type = wlib.types.file pkgs;
      default.path = gitIniFmt.generate "gitconfig" config.settings;
      description = "Generated git configuration file.";
    };
  };

  config.env.GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL = config.configFile.path;
  config.package = lib.mkDefault pkgs.git;
  config.meta.maintainers = [ wlib.maintainers.birdee ];
}
```

On the other hand, using `wlib.types.file` makes it more difficult to accept `${placeholder "out"}` within the generated configuration and have it point to the final derivation.

So, if this might be important for your program, you can consider providing a different way to override the path. But in most cases, `${placeholder "out"}` is only something you use in the `config.drv` options when adding new files to the wrapper derivation itself. So, generally, using `wlib.types.file` is better for uniformity.

# Formatting

`nix fmt`

# Tests

`nix flake check -Lv`

# Writing tests

You may also include a `check.nix` file in your module's directory.

It will be provided with the flake `self` value and `pkgs`

It should build a derivation which tests the wrapper derivation as best you can.

If a command fails, it fails the test. If it builds the derivation successfully, it passes the test.

If the program gives options for running the program to check the generated configuration is correct, you should do that.

Sometimes it is not easily possible to run the program within a derivation, in those cases, searching the wrapper derivation and other generated files and their contents is also acceptable.

Example:

```nix
{
  pkgs,
  self,
}:
let
  gitWrapped = self.wrappedModules.git.wrap {
    inherit pkgs;
    settings = {
      user = {
        name = "Test User";
        email = "test@example.com";
      };
    };
  };

in
pkgs.runCommand "git-test" { } ''
  "${gitWrapped}/bin/git" config user.name | grep -q "Test User"
  "${gitWrapped}/bin/git" config user.email | grep -q "test@example.com"
  touch $out
''
```

For new additions, the description should be `init`, with any further explanation on subsequent lines

Changes to helper modules should be titled `type(modules.<name>): some description`.
For new additions, the description should be `init`, with any further explanation on subsequent lines

For `lib` additions and changes, the description should be `type(lib.<set>.<name>): some description` or `type(lib.<name>): some description`.

For template additions and changes, the description should be `type(templates.<name>): some description`.

Changes to the core options set defined in `lib/core.nix` should be titled `type(core): some description`.

`type` refers to a one word tag [like `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, or `test`](https://gist.github.com/Zekfad/f51cb06ac76e2457f11c80ed705c95a3#commit-types) as specified by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)

For everything else, do the best you can to follow conventional commit message style.

Why specify this? I was having trouble figuring out what to title my commits. So now I know.
